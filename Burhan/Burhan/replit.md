# ARC Prize 2025 Solver

## Overview
This project is a Python-based solver for the ARC (Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus) Prize 2025. The system is designed to tackle abstract reasoning puzzles using a combination of constraint satisfaction, pattern recognition, and various AI techniques.

**Purpose**: Develop algorithms to solve ARC puzzles by identifying patterns and transformations between input and output grids.

**Current State**: Environment setup complete with all required libraries installed and project structure initialized.

## Recent Changes
- **2025-09-11**: Initial project setup
  - Installed Python 3.11 environment
  - Added scientific computing libraries (NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, scikit-learn)
  - Added specialized libraries (OR-Tools for constraint programming, NetworkX for graph algorithms, Pillow for image processing)
  - Created organized project structure with dedicated folders for different components

## Development Notes

### Running the Project
Execute `python main.py` to verify the environment setup and see installed libraries.

### Next Steps
1. Implement data loading utilities for ARC puzzles
2. Develop basic grid transformation functions
3. Create constraint satisfaction problem formulations
4. Build pattern recognition algorithms
5. Implement solver strategies
